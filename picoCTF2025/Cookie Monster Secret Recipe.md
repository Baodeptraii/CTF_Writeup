Hints:  
Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?  
Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!  
Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.  

After login into the website, it said something about "cookie" so i check my cookie after login and i found the text look like decrypt message.  
There are two `%3D` at the end which equal to `==` in ASCII which really look like Base64. Using Base64 decode to get the flag.  
Peace!
