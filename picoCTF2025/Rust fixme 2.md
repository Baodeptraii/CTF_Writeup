Description:  
The Rust saga continues? I ask you, can I borrow that, pleeeeeaaaasseeeee?  
Hints:  
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html  

Same job as level 1, the instruction in the hint is very clear, you can read the document and complete the fixing syntax.

- How do we pass values to a function that we want to change? => `&mut String`
- Is this variable changeable? => `let mut party_foul`
- Is this the correct way to pass a value to a function so that it can be changed? => `&mut party_foul`

  Run code with `cargo run` and you get the flag.  
  Peace!
