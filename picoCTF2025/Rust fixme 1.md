Description:  
Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!
Hints:  
Cargo is Rust's package manager and will make your life easier. See the getting started page here  
println!  
Rust has some pretty great compiler error messages. Read them maybe?  

To run Rust code, you need to set up the enviroment with `cargo`, click on number 1 hint to see the instruction.  
The `main.rs` has some syntax errors, they're all basic and even commented in src code:  
- How do we end statements in Rust? => `;`  
- How do we return in rust? => `return;`  
- How do we print out a variable in the println function? => `println!("{}", ...);`

After correct all of them, run the code with `cargo run` and you have the flag ( make sure you `cd` to right place) .  
Peace!
