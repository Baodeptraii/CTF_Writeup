Check whatever Facebook is called now.  

Using some command like `pngcheck` and `exiftools` i received nothing but a poem:  
```
Crimson heart, vibrant and bold,.
Hearts flutter at your sight..
Evenings glow softly red,.
Cherries burst with sweet life..
Kisses linger with your warmth..
Love deep as merlot..
Scarlet leaves falling softly,.
Bold in every stroke.
```
Using another Forensic tool like `zsteg` to checking and i got something like the number 3 hint : "meta" and the Base64 code of the poem also. Decode it and we have the flag.  
Peace!
