Description:  
A company stored a secret message on a server which got breached due to the admin using weakly hashed passwords. Can you gain access to the secret stored within the server?  
Access the server using nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 57356  

Hints:  
Understanding hashes is very crucial.  
Can you identify the hash algorithm? Look carefully at the length and structure of each hash identified.  
Tried using any hash cracking tools?  

Just using any Hash Identify and Hash Decrypt tools. The order of algorithm is MD5 -> SHA1 -> SHA256.  

Peace!
