Description:  
Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!  
Hints:  
Read the comments...darn it!  

In my opinion, they made 3 levels of Rust code just for us learning Rust syntax.  
To get the flag, just uncomment `unsafe` block in the code and run with cargo.  
Peace!
