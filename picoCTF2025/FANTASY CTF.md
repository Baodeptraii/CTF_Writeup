Description:  
Play this short game to get familiar with terminal applications and some of the most important rules in scope for picoCTF.  
Connect to the program with netcat:  
`$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 58889`  
Hints:  
When a choice is presented like [a/b/c], choose one, for example: c and then press Enter.

I have no idea with this challenge. Just `Enter` and `a` .   

Peace!
