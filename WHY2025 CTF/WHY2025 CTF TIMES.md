Access the web and `Ctrl+U ` to view the source code.  
We can see this `js` file contain something:

It's obfuscated, but easily unobfuscated by using online tool or just open it in Dev-tool on browser (f12).  
`Ctrl+F` to find the flag and we can see it is in line 3:

The flag contain many pieces in a lot of functions, we can run full code in devtool and `console.log(line3);` to make it print the flag ... or just "AI" it.  

Peace!
