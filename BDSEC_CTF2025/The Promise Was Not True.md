This one is tricky:   
```
[$1=$[\%1\]?~[$1-f;!*]?]f:
10f;!.
```
1. Function Definition (f)
The function f is recursive and checks two conditions:

Base case: If the input $1 (top of the stack) equals 1, it does something ($[\%1\]?).

Recursive case: Otherwise, it decrements the input and multiplies (~[$1-f;!*]?).

This strongly resembles a factorial function:

> n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1

The base case is `1! = 1.`

The recursive case is `n! = n × (n-1)!.`

2. Execution with 10
When we call 10f;!., it computes 10! (10 factorial):
>10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × ... × 1 = 3,628,800

`3,628,800` is a 7-digit number, matching the passcode requirement.

3. This WU is "AI generated" but still fun to learn, right ?  

Peace!
